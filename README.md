# jet-blog-title

Just drop this into your plugins folder, activate it, and enjoy seeing the right title in your blog page header.

Caveat: it runs on vanilla JavaScript. So the -0.0001% of people who aren't using it won't see the resulting content in the header.

Caveat++: No guarantees. This is free and always kind of in-progress.
